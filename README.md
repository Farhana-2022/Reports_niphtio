# Reports_niphtio
A detailed bug report and a test report on Niphtio application are included in this repo.
For reference, test status report is also included. 
Niphtio is a web-based application with no software required to install or download, enables users to access the application on all their devices. The application provides the most convenient way to save, find, and read interesting pages which can be found again later. All the items in the user library can be marked with tags including ‘To do’ items. Hence less time spent looking for content and more time using it to achieve what users really want. 
Functional Testing is performed on the application focusing on most of the main features such as signing up, logging in, logging out, changing settings of accoount, saving web pages as items in library, searching items, using tags for items, marking items as To Do and trashing items.
As per client requirement, manual testing is performed with 58 test cases planned, of which 5 were not executed. 87% of the test cases executed passed with very few bugs considered not critical need fixing.
